# 36 year old gambler who has been betting on games for 18 years legally and picking games since was old enough to take it seriously. I spend hours everyday sifting through all the games and looking through stats to come up with my best straight and parlay bets. I hope you join me on this journey of making money and picking winners they won't be free very long!! Some amazing art is being worked on right now to launch a NFT project that will provide lifetime access to my picks for holders!!! Other utilities will be rev share from collateral loans, weekly alpha contest where the winning team gets rev from that trade, weekly biggest parlays odds contest, and so much more can't give it all away to soon.


# Full write-ups on research of my picks and why i chose them. No just giving you the games without any info. I would rather you know the information and stats even if i makes you choose the otherside and it Wins. Im about making the community the most money possible not always being right!!! 


# Alpha on everything from basketball, baseball, hockey, football, pro and college
